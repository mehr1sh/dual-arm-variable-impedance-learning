**Impedance Control of Robot Motion**

1. While talking about mothion and hybrid forrce emotion control - a big assumption - the environment is infinitely rigid meaning yoru robot will treat both hard and soft objects the same way which we need to consider because that makes the robot quite dangerous 
2. Impedance is the resistance of an object against deformation - the higher the impedance of a surface the more it resists to deformation
