**Forward kinematics**
Given an object's location in end-effector frame(x), find its location(X) in the frame fixed at robot's base. 

1. Define and draw the fixed and end-effeector frames.
2. Draw a frame at each joint with its x axis parallel to the next link
3. Mark out the rotation angles (ANTICLOCKWISE)
4.
