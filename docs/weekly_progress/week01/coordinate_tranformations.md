**Coordinate Transfprmations**
it is the changing of the coordinate system 
its taking a point in one coordinate system and defining it with respect of another coordinate system.

why do we need them? 
The same point expresses in the moving frame M is x and when expresses in fixed frame F is X.

Expressing M relative to F:
1. Pure translation - No rotation of frame M relative to frame F, only translation.
2. Pure Rotation - M and F coincident origin - M rotated wrt F 
3. Both - Initially m and F coincide, then M displaced by d then M rotated by theta
